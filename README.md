# Timelock - a shell-based time tracking utility


## Disclaimer

I'm learning shell scripting and this is my pet project.
Don't judge strictly :) Use these scripts on your own risk.


## Rationale

This tool needed to track working hours without signing in with Google,
X, or smth.. It also don't require Internet and frees you from interacting
with poorly organized GUI.


## Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/roflganker/timelock.git
sh timelock/install.sh  # Run this as superuser (sudo)
rm -rf timelock  # Remove source code (optionally)
```


## Usage

```shell
# Recording time
tl start  # Start working
tl link  # Assign a URL to your work
tl status  # Get currect work status  
tl change  # Change current work subject
tl stop  # Stop working and track time

# History
tl history  # Get all history
tl history -f all|week|today|yesterday  # Get filtered history

# Jira worklogs
tl connect  # Connect with Jira
tl commit  # Send last worklog to Jira
```


### Prompt

You may wish to view your time in command brompt. Example using bash:

```bash
# ~/.bashrc

tl_prompt() {
  local hms 
  if hms="$(tl status -u 2>/dev/null)"; then
    echo "‚è≥[$hms]"
  fi
}

PS1="\u@\h:\w\$(tl_prompt)$ "
```


## TODO

- Unit/e2e test coverage
- Compatibility tests for `bash`, `ash`, `zsh`, etc...
- Use Makefile for linting and installation
- History cleaning
- Batch commit (today, yesterday, week)
- Enhanced completion (include options)
- Project/workspace separation (separate history, status and Jira)
- Work time summaries (`tl summary -f <filter>`)
