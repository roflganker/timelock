# tt.sh - a shell-based time tracking utility


## Disclaimer

I'm just learning shell scripting, don't judge strictly :)
Use these scripts on your own risk.


## Installation

```shell
# In progress...
```


## Usage

```shell
./tt.sh start  # Start working
./tt.sh status  # Get currect work status  
./tt.sh stop  # Stop working and track time
./tt.sh rotate  # Track time and switch to another task
./tt.sh history  # Get history (for now, use grep for filtering)
```


## TODO

- History filters
- Unit/e2e test coverage
- Compatilibity tests for `bash`, `ash`, `zsh`, etc...
- Installation script, linking somewhere to $PATH
- Integration with team services: Jira, Redmine... (maybe)
